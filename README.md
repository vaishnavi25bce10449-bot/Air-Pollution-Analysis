Air Quality Analysis ModelTable of ContentsIntroductionFeaturesInstallationUsageDataDependenciesContributingLicense1. IntroductionThis repository hosts a Python-based model designed for analyzing and visualizing air quality data. The model is built using common data science libraries, providing tools for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), time-series forecasting of pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, NO2, O3), and source apportionment insights.The primary goal is to provide a reliable, easily reproducible framework for understanding air pollution trends and predicting future air quality index (AQI) values.2. FeaturesData Ingestion: Supports loading time-series air quality data from CSV or JSON files.Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, performs data normalization, and resamples time-series data to standard intervals (e.g., hourly, daily).Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generates plots and statistical summaries of key pollutants.Time-series plots of pollutant concentrations.Correlation matrices between pollutants and meteorological factors (temperature, humidity).Seasonal and diurnal variation analysis.Modeling & Forecasting: Implements time-series forecasting techniques (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM models) to predict future pollutant concentrations and AQI.Visualization: Produces interactive and static visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn/Plotly.Report Generation: Capability to generate a summary report of the analysis findings.Time Series ComponentsRandomTrendSeasonalCycleGetty Images3. InstallationPrerequisitesYou need Python 3.8+ installed on your system.StepsClone the repository:Bashgit clone [https://github.com/yourusername/air-quality-analysis.git](https://github.com/yourusername/air-quality-analysis.git)
cd air-quality-analysis
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):Bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
Install the required packages:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
4. UsageThe main entry point for the analysis is typically a Jupyter Notebook or a main Python script.Running the AnalysisTo run a full analysis pipeline, execute the main script:Bashpython main_analysis.py --data_file data/raw_air_quality.csv --pollutant PM2.5 --model_type ARIMA

DataThe model is designed to work with time-series air quality datasets.FormatThe input data file (e.g., data/raw_air_quality.csv) must contain:A DateTime column (must be parseable as a date/time object).Columns for various Pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, O3).Optional Meteorological columns (e.g., Temperature, Humidity, WindSpeed).Example DataA sample data file is provided in the data/ directory (sample_data.csv) for testing purposes.6. DependenciesAll required packages are listed in requirements.txt. Key dependencies include:pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.numpy: Numerical operations.scikit-learn: Machine learning utilities (scaling, metrics).matplotlib & seaborn: Static data visualization.statsmodels / Prophet / tensorflow (optional): Time-series modeling and forecasting.7.
